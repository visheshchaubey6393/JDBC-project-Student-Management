Student Management(JDBC project)

This repository contains a Java JDBC project for Student Management. It is a simple console-based application that allows users to manage student records in a MySQL database.

Features:
- Add new students with their name, contact information, and city.
- View all student records in the database.
- Search for a student by name.

The project is built using Java, JDBC (Java Database Connectivity), and MySQL. It demonstrates basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using a relational database.
